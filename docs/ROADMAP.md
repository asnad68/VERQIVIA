- [x] Production JWT authentication and scope authorization
- [x] Serializable transaction/retry and concurrency hardening
- [x] Production deployment boundary: OCI image, hardened Kubernetes baseline, secret contract, migration/runtime role separation, health/readiness, backup/restore runbook, observability requirements, and fail-closed single-tenant boundary
- [x] Cryptographic proof layer: SHA-256 resource binding, Ed25519 proof envelope, issuer/key registry, durable persistence, public API verification and interoperability tests
- [x] Repository release preflight and public-demo parity checks
- [x] Final repository readiness and external launch-gate document

- [x] Define separate authenticated write-ingestion boundary
