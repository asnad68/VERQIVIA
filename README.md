# VERQIVIA

## Business Identity & Verification Infrastructure

> **Your brand is yours. Your identity travels with it.**

VERQIVIA is an experimental project exploring a portable, interoperable and machine-verifiable identity layer for businesses, brands, digital channels and authorized agents.

The project is now developed under the project name:

**VERQIVIA**

The v0.1 protocol identifiers (`NTH-*`) and `NOTHING_*` environment-variable namespace are retained for backward compatibility.

---

## The Problem

A modern company can have many identities across the digital world:

- Legal entity
- Brand
- Trademark
- Domains
- Websites
- Social accounts
- Apps
- Marketplaces
- Authorized representatives
- Distributors and partners
- AI agents
- Commerce endpoints

The difficult question is no longer only:

> **Who is this company?**

It is also:

> **Which digital identity actually belongs to it, and what is authorized?**

VERQIVIA explores a common verification layer that can connect these relationships and make them easier for both humans and machines to verify.

---

## The Core Idea

VERQIVIA is designed around five principles:

**Identity** — Give a business a stable digital identity reference.

**Evidence** — Record what a claim is based on.

**Verification** — Make the status of each claim understandable and checkable.

**Authorization** — Represent what a company or authorized party is allowed to do.

**Revocation** — Make it possible to show when an earlier assertion is no longer valid.

The long-term vision is:

> **One business identity. Many proofs. One simple way to verify.**

## Product Direction — Portable Verification Layer

The intended product is not a second trademark registry. It is a reusable verification layer that lets an organization publish a structured identity once and lets procurement teams, marketplaces, business software and AI agents inspect that identity wherever it is used.

The product surfaces are:

1. **Verify Web** for people.
2. **Portable Verification Profile** for machine-readable exchange.
3. **API** for software and marketplaces.
4. **◇ verification marker** as a human-facing entry point to the canonical record.
5. **Domain discovery** through `.well-known/verqivia.json` as a pointer to the canonical record.

See:
- `docs/PRODUCT-VISION.md`
- `docs/PORTABLE-VERIFICATION-PROFILE.md`
- `schema/portable-verification-profile.schema.json`
- `examples/portable-profile.example.json`

### Why this can matter to a large company

A global company does not need VERQIVIA to obtain trademark ownership. The potential value is elsewhere: external parties could resolve a company identity and inspect a specific claim, its evidence, verification scope, and lifecycle instead of trusting a copied name, logo or claimed relationship.

The commercial hypothesis is therefore:

> **Publish identity once. Let others verify it anywhere.**

This remains a product hypothesis until real organizations participate in controlled pilots.

### Official organization control

VERQIVIA separates authentication from authorization.

A Google account or crypto wallet can authenticate an operator, but neither one alone proves the operator is entitled to represent a company or brand. Official organization registration therefore requires independent organization-domain control and a brand/domain binding decision.

The intended automatic gate is:

```text
Google Workspace or SIWE
        ↓
Authenticated principal
        ↓
DNS TXT domain control
        ↓
Brand ↔ domain binding
        ↓
ORGANIZATION-CONTROLLED
```

Personal Gmail accounts and unrelated wallets cannot create an official organization claim for an unrelated brand merely by typing its name.

See `docs/REGISTRATION-AUTHORIZATION.md` for the full policy.

---

## Legacy NTH Identity ID

Each identity may receive a stable reference such as:

`NTH-000001`

A VERQIVIA ID is **not**:

- A government registration number
- A trademark registration
- A legal certification
- A replacement for company registration
- A replacement for domain registration
- A financial or banking credential

It is a project-level identifier that can reference a business identity record and its associated claims.

---

## Claim-Based Verification

VERQIVIA is intentionally designed to avoid a single, misleading "trust score".

Different claims may have different statuses.

Example:

```text
Legal Entity       VERIFIED
Domain Control     VERIFIED
Official Website   VERIFIED
Trademark          VERIFIED
Social Account     UNVERIFIED
Distributor        NOT VERIFIED
AI Agent           VERIFIED
```

This makes the system more precise than a single green badge.

---

## Verification Statuses

The initial prototype uses four basic states:

### VERIFIED

A claim has been verified using an appropriate verification method and evidence.

### SOURCE-VERIFIED

A claim has been checked against an authoritative or otherwise reliable external source.

### SELF-CLAIMED

The organization has provided the information, but the project has not yet completed sufficient independent verification.

### REVOKED

A previously valid assertion is no longer valid.

The exact verification rules will evolve as the project is tested.

---

## VERQIVIA Passport™

**VERQIVIA Passport** is the working name for the user-facing business identity record.

A future passport may connect:

```text
Legal Entity
      |
      +---- Brand
      +---- Trademark
      +---- Official Domains
      +---- Official Channels
      +---- Authorized People
      +---- Authorized Partners
      +---- Authorized AI Agents
      +---- Commerce Endpoints
```

The Passport is intended to make these relationships easier to understand and verify.

---

## VERQIVIA Mark ◇

The project also explores a simple visual marker:

**◇**

The mark is not the product by itself.

Its purpose is to provide a simple human-facing entry point to verification.

A future implementation might allow a user to select:

**Brand ◇ → Verify Identity**

The visual mark only has meaning when it points to a verifiable record.

---

## For Machines

VERQIVIA is intended to be machine-readable as well as human-readable.

The v1 API now exposes a machine-readable portable profile endpoint so software, marketplaces, websites and AI agents can resolve a VERQIVIA ID and inspect its claims without screen scraping.

Conceptual example:

```http
GET /v1/identity/NTH-000001
```

Conceptual response:

```json
{
  "id": "NTH-000001",
  "status": "VERIFIED",
  "brand": "Example Company",
  "official_domains": [
    "example.com"
  ],
  "revoked": false
}
```

The exact API and schema are experimental and will change during development.

---

## Security Principles

Security is part of the architecture from the beginning.

The project is designed around principles including:

- Least privilege
- Secure development practices
- Separation of secrets from source code
- Cryptographic signatures where appropriate
- Key rotation
- Credential revocation
- Auditability
- Rate limiting
- Abuse prevention
- Minimal data collection
- Dependency and supply-chain awareness

No private keys, passwords or production secrets belong in this repository.

---

## Privacy Principles

VERQIVIA follows a simple rule:

> **Collect less. Prove more.**

The prototype should avoid collecting unnecessary personal information.

VERQIVIA is not intended to become a repository of passports, identity documents, banking information or other highly sensitive personal data.

Privacy requirements will be reviewed for each jurisdiction before real-world commercial deployment.

---

## Legal Position

This repository contains an experimental prototype and research project.

VERQIVIA does not claim to be:

- A government authority
- A trademark office
- A certificate authority
- A qualified trust service provider
- A bank
- A payment institution
- A financial regulator
- A legal authority
- An official representative of any third-party brand

References to companies or standards do not imply endorsement, partnership or authorization.

The project is independent and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any third-party brand**.

Third-party trademarks remain the property of their respective owners.

**Brand-clearance note:** before filing or materially expanding commercial use of the exact word mark `VERQIVIA`, complete a professional trademark/name-clearance review for the intended goods/services and jurisdictions. The project does not currently represent `VERQIVIA` as a registered trademark for this project.

---

## Payments — Deferred Phase

Payment processing is intentionally frozen while the identity and verification core is developed.

- No new payment features are being developed in this phase.
- No Visa, Mastercard, bank transfer or card checkout is exposed by the identity prototype.
- Existing payment code remains in the repository but is outside the current implementation scope.
- Cryptocurrency settlement will be revisited only as a final commercial phase after legal structure, jurisdiction/AML-CFT review, custody/key-management controls, reconciliation and security gates are satisfied.

**No real-money payment flow is part of the current identity-core release.**

## Technology Direction

VERQIVIA aims to build on open standards rather than create unnecessary proprietary systems.

Relevant areas of research include:

- W3C Verifiable Credentials
- OpenID for Verifiable Credentials
- GLEIF / Legal Entity Identifier ecosystem
- BIMI
- GS1 Digital Link
- Web security standards
- Modern cryptographic signing and key management

The project is intended to complement existing infrastructure rather than replace systems that already solve adjacent problems.

---

## Zero-Dollar Prototype

The initial development goal is:

> **Prove the product before spending money.**

The prototype is intended to run using free developer infrastructure where practical.

The first phase is not intended to require:

- Paid hosting
- Paid advertising
- Paid databases
- Employees
- Office space
- Payment processing
- Expensive enterprise software

Free-tier limits and provider policies can change over time.

---

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Concept

Define the problem, terminology, principles and legal boundaries.

### Phase 1 — Identity Schema

Define the structure of a VERQIVIA ID and its claims.

### Phase 2 — Verification + Cryptographic Proof

Build claim verification, evidence handling, status management, revocation, SHA-256 resource binding and Ed25519 proof verification.

### Phase 3 — Verify Web

Create a simple public verification page.

### Phase 4 — API

Allow software to query business identities programmatically.

### Phase 5 — Pilot

Test the system with real businesses that voluntarily participate.

### Phase 6 — Network

Explore integrations with marketplaces, business software and AI systems.

### Phase 7 — Commercial Infrastructure

Introduce paid enterprise services only after utility, security and legal requirements are established.

---

## Prototype Success Criteria

The first version should succeed at three things:

### For people

A normal user can understand the identity status within seconds.

### For businesses

A business can present a portable and updateable identity record.

### For machines

Software can query a structured record and receive a clear result.

### For ecosystems

The same identity can be resolved through a public verification page, a portable profile, a future production API and a domain discovery pointer.

If the prototype cannot achieve these four goals simply and reliably, the product needs to change.

---

## Development Philosophy

VERQIVIA follows:

> **Prove before spending.**  
> **Verify before claiming.**  
> **Minimize data.**  
> **Use open standards.**  
> **Build for humans and machines.**

The project should earn trust through transparent verification rather than through slogans.

## Commercial Access

The current public release supports controlled pilots and early commercial engagements. See `docs/SALES-AND-PRICING.md` and the public [Commercial](site/commercial.html) and [Terms](site/terms.html) pages.

Production SaaS remains gated by deployment, authentication, persistent infrastructure, security, key-governance and jurisdiction-specific legal/privacy requirements.

```

The architecture deliberately keeps these layers separate:

```text
Identity
   ↓
Claim
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Verification Event
   ↓
Versioned Procedure
```

Verify Web is the human-facing read layer, while `api/openapi.json` is the deployment-neutral machine API contract. The future API server should call the protocol resolver instead of duplicating its rules.

### Local Prototype Validation

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The structural validator checks data contracts only. The protocol resolver checks cross-record relationships and procedure compatibility. Neither one independently proves that an external source is truthful.

### Machine / AI Consumption

The preferred machine endpoint is:

```
GET /v1/identity/{nothing_id}/profile
```

It returns the additive VERQIVIA Portable Verification Profile (0.2-draft). Consumers should inspect claim-level status, scope, revocation and verification context rather than treating VERQIVIA as a universal trust score.

See `docs/AI-MACHINE-INTEGRATION.md`.

### API Contract

The public API is versioned under `v1`. Public resources are read-only, while `POST /v1/ingestion/bundles` provides a separately authenticated write boundary for identities, evidence and verification events. The API contract specifies identity resolution, evidence retrieval, verification-event retrieval and exact procedure-version retrieval, plus errors, ETags, conditional requests, freshness metadata and rate-limit behavior.

The write route requires a bearer credential and `Idempotency-Key`, validates the complete affected graph and commits one atomic transaction. Procedures remain outside the ingestion write surface.

The API contract intentionally exposes the resolved verification graph instead of a universal trust score. The HTTP layer is storage-agnostic and now has a durable SQLite reference backend plus a documented PostgreSQL production target.

## Cryptographic Proof Layer v0.1

The repository now includes a detached Ed25519 proof envelope, an issuer/key registry, deterministic signing input, a public demo key discovery document and tamper/key-lifecycle tests. The proof layer establishes integrity and signer-key binding for an exact resource; it does not by itself establish the truth of the underlying claim.

See `docs/CRYPTOGRAPHIC-PROOF.md` and `docs/ROADMAP-CRYPTO-PROOF.md`.

## Commercial Pilot

The repository now includes a public pilot landing page, a commercial pilot framework and a starting pilot agreement template. These materials are for controlled discussions with prospective participants; they do not describe pilot participants as customers or certifications without written authorization.

See `docs/COMMERCIAL-PILOT.md` and `docs/PILOT-AGREEMENT-TEMPLATE.md`.

## License

The licensing model for the prototype is not yet finalized.

Until a license is added to this repository, please treat the source code as **all rights reserved** and do not redistribute or commercially reuse it without permission.

---

## Disclaimer

This project is experimental.

Nothing in this repository constitutes legal, financial, regulatory, cybersecurity or compliance advice.

Before commercial deployment, the project will require jurisdiction-specific legal, privacy, security and regulatory review.


## Engineering Guardrails

The project now has an automated test workflow, a deterministic structural validator, JSON Schema parity tests, a cross-record protocol resolver, a versioned verification procedure registry, a Verify Web prototype, an OpenAPI contract, a threat model and an explicit verification protocol. These are intentionally conservative foundations: technical validity is kept separate from evidence-based verification.

The next implementation work should preserve backward compatibility of the v0.1 identity contract. Breaking schema changes should use an explicit version rather than silently changing the meaning of existing records.
